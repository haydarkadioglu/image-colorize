# image-colorize
Colorize images with Python deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Notebooks

### test_colorize.ipynb
This notebook is used for testing the image colorization process. It contains code to load grayscale images and apply a pre-trained model to colorize them. The results are displayed within the notebook for easy visualization.

#### Code Explanation
1. **Import Libraries**: The necessary libraries for image processing and model loading are imported.
2. **Load Grayscale Images**: The grayscale images that need to be colorized are loaded into the notebook.
3. **Load Pre-trained Model**: A pre-trained colorization model is loaded. This model has been trained on a large dataset of images to learn how to add color to grayscale images.
4. **Colorize Images**: The pre-trained model is applied to the grayscale images to generate colorized versions.
5. **Display Results**: The original grayscale images and their colorized versions are displayed side by side for comparison.

### colorize_with_GAN.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image colorization. It includes code to build and train a GAN model on grayscale images and then use the trained model to generate colorized versions of the images. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions and visual results.

#### Code Explanation
1. **Import Libraries**: The necessary libraries for deep learning, image processing, and GANs are imported.
2. **Load Dataset**: The dataset of grayscale images is loaded. These images will be used to train the GAN model.
3. **Preprocess Data**: The images are preprocessed, including resizing and normalization, to prepare them for training.
4. **Build GAN Model**: The GAN model is built, consisting of a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates colorized images from grayscale images, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated images.
5. **Train GAN Model**: The GAN model is trained on the dataset. During training, the generator and discriminator are updated iteratively to improve the quality of the colorized images.
6. **Generate Colorized Images**: After training, the generator is used to colorize new grayscale images.
7. **Evaluate Results**: The colorized images are evaluated and displayed to visualize the performance of the GAN model.

The specific code snippet `len(color_img)` is used to get the number of images in the `color_img` list. This list contains the colorized images generated by the GAN model. By checking the length of this list, you can determine how many images have been processed and colorized by the model. This is useful for verifying that the model has processed the expected number of images and for further analysis of the results.
